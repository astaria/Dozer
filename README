== Welcome to Dozer

Dozer is a node.js based website classifier. Some set of website URLs can be
placed in data.js. Fire up the server and the user can view the website
full-screen with floating controls. Next moves to the next URL, previous goes
back.

I was using it for going through a long list of document IDs on
Notesolution.com. If a document was interesting then I have it set up
to save the ID in a Redis list if the user clicks the "Current" button
on the control panel.

The framework of Dozer could be useful to someone who wanted to quickly go
through a list of websites and classify some aspect of them.

== Installation

You need a working node.js and npm. Then:

npm install haml
npm install redis

Obviously you need redis isntalled. Also, sass and haml. When everthing is
ready to go:

./run.sh

Then a user can navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:8124/

To begin to classify sites.
